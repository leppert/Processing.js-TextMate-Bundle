Installation
===============

At it's foundation, the Processing.js bundle ties together language patterns from the Javascript bundle that ships with TextMate and the Processing bundle created for the original Java implementation of Processing. Without both of these installed, the Processing.js bundle won't function properly. Check your Bundles menu to see that both are present and if either or both are missing they can be acquired via SVN at the following locations:

	Javascript Bundle	http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/JavaScript.tmbundle/
	Processing Bundle	http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Processing.tmbundle/
